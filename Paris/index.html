      <!-- I left this alone, but I have a slight reservation about using an <h2> here. Becuase structurally it implies that it's on par with Paris. At the same time, I know the Weekend is higher up the chain than the favorite spots and the month-->
      <h2>A Weekend on the Seine</h2>
      <p>I was lucky enough to spend three days visiting Paris this month! I went with a friend and we were able to see many things while we were there!</p>
      <!-- Left these <h4> alone too but I think you could make them <h3>s and the page outline would still be structurally sound -->
      <h4 id="day1">Day 1</h4>
      <!-- In this paragraph I used <i> instead of <em> because I feel <i> is more symantically appropriate. <em> is more for screen readers and assitive devices -->
      <p>On our first day, we started by visiting <i>Montmartre</i> right away. Our second stop was the Eiffel Tower (check out that beautiful picture!) We ate dinner at a cute little bistro overlooking <i>la Seine</i>.</p>

      <h4 id="day2">Day 2</h4>
      <p>On our second day, we went shopping on <i>Avenue des Champs Elysees</i>. Every single person we saw was dressed in the height of fashion.</p>
      <!-- Line breaks are not necessary here. In my opinion, using two <p> is just as good and will be easier to style later-->
      <p>After we finished shopping, we visited some really beautiful places! We went to <i>Notre Dame</i>. We went on a macaron tour of Paris and ate all of the best macarons the city had to offer. After we finished shopping, we visited <i>le Louvre</i>.</p>

      <h4 id="day3">Day 3</h4>
      <p>The picture below is of me visiting the <i>Arc de Triomphe</i>. It's huge! We also went to <i>le Musee D'Orsay</i>. Seeing the work of Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh in person was completely breathtaking. I was surprised to see that the museum also had many sculptures including those by Auguste Rodin, Paul Gauguin, and Alfred Barye.</p>
